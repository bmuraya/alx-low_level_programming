## 0x1C. C - Makefiles


## 
A Makefile is a special kind of text file used in software development to automate the process of building executable programs or libraries from source code. It is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, and it works by defining rules and dependencies between files, allowing developers to specify how source files should be compiled and linked together.
